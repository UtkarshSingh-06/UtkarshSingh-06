## 🚀 Projects

### Phishing Website Detection System — Deep Learning & NLP
**Tech Stack:** Python, CNN, LSTM, BERT, URL-BERT, PyTorch, FastAPI

Developed a machine learning system to detect phishing websites using URL-based, lexical, and content-based features.

* Implemented CNN + LSTM architectures to capture sequential URL patterns and malicious behavior.
* Integrated Transformer-based models (BERT, URL-BERT) for semantic analysis of URLs and webpage content.
* Designed scalable feature extraction pipelines including token statistics, entropy measures, and domain metadata.
* Exposed predictions through a FastAPI backend with explainable risk scores.

### Liquidity Management Bot — DeFi Automation
**Tech Stack:** Python, Solana, Raydium CLMM, Web3, Docker, DigitalOcean

Built an automated DeFi bot to manage liquidity positions in the SOL–USDC CLMM pool on Raydium.

* Implemented dynamic rebalancing strategies based on price movement, pool ranges, and impermanent loss thresholds.
* Enabled environment-based configuration using .env files for strategy tuning and non-technical deployment.
* Deployed the bot on a cloud server with fault tolerance, logging, and automated execution.

## 🚀 Projects

### Phishing Website Detection System — Deep Learning & NLP
**Tech Stack:** Python, CNN, LSTM, BERT, URL-BERT, PyTorch, FastAPI

Developed a machine learning system to detect phishing websites using URL-based, lexical, and content-based features.

* Implemented CNN + LSTM architectures to capture sequential URL patterns and malicious behavior.
* Integrated Transformer-based models (BERT, URL-BERT) for semantic analysis of URLs and webpage content.
* Designed scalable feature extraction pipelines including token statistics, entropy measures, and domain metadata.
* Exposed predictions through a FastAPI backend with explainable risk scores.

### Liquidity Management Bot — DeFi Automation
**Tech Stack:** Python, Solana, Raydium CLMM, Web3, Docker, DigitalOcean

Built an automated DeFi bot to manage liquidity positions in the SOL–USDC CLMM pool on Raydium.

* Implemented dynamic rebalancing strategies based on price movement, pool ranges, and impermanent loss thresholds.
* Enabled environment-based configuration using .env files for strategy tuning and non-technical deployment.
* Deployed the bot on a cloud server with fault tolerance, logging, and automated execution.

### Cloud-Based Bookstore Platform
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, React, MySQL, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)

Developed a cloud-hosted bookstore application with inventory management, search functionality, and order workflows.

* Designed relational database schemas for books, users, orders, and inventory management.
* Implemented RESTful APIs and deployed the platform on AWS EC2 with persistent storage and backups.
* Added notification mechanisms for inventory updates and order status tracking.

### AI Chatbot for Data Leakage Detection
**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, MySQL, NLP, AWS

Built an AI-powered chatbot to detect, report, and explain potential data leakage incidents.

* Applied NLP techniques to analyze logs, queries, and user input for sensitive data exposure patterns.
* Stored conversation history and incident metadata in MySQL for auditing and compliance analysis.
* Deployed the system on AWS with secure API endpoints.

### DecentraVault — Web3 Asset Management Platform
**Tech Stack:** Solidity, Ethereum, Hardhat, React, Ethers.js, IPFS

Developed a decentralized asset management platform enabling secure storage, transfer, and time-locked digital assets.

* Designed and deployed Solidity smart contracts with role-based permissions and security best practices.
* Integrated wallet-based authentication and transactions using Ethers.js and MetaMask.
* Stored metadata and proofs on IPFS for decentralized persistence.
* Tested smart contracts using Hardhat with unit and integration coverage.
